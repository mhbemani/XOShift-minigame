1-  be aware, when a shift happens, there is two possiabilities:
    - first:    there is at least one free space, so the blocks will be pushed and will 
                fill the blank spaces
    
    - second:   there is no free space, then all will be pushed the the last block will 
                be pushed out (removed)

2-  the current agent acts good on 3x3 against random and sample agents, exceptable 
    against 4x4, but not good against 5x5. the responces are missed (duo to lake of time)

3-  there is a code on going in chatGPT_AI_final_project, hope it fixes the problem

4-  an idea for better performance would be this:
        create a huristic which you can fully trust
        then, instead of going in the next depth and finding all the possiabilities for
        each move, only check the deeper moves for the best cases (only if there is more 
        than one, or, in another strategy you can like go on for the best 3 cases) you 
        already have, then calculate the best move of those, add them to current best 
        cases(but waighted, like 0.3 , 0.2 , ... ), and then provide the best case accroding
        to what we calcualted now. this way needs a powerfull huristic, otherwise this
        method will performe wrost that what we already have.
        also this method is based on luck, but what we already have is not, but its also
        takes more time(the current method)

5-  if none of these worked out, we must go after another strategy. maybe more complicated
    or totally new evaluation functions
